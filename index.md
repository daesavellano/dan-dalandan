- TODO: look at the raw markdown below for examples of making links, bold, colors, quotes, etc.
- TODO: replace the content of this file with a description of the concept of your restaurant
  - this markdown file will become the home page of the website automatically, so include
    information that you think belongs on the home page.
  - remember, two colleagues will review your site!
  - use good markdown style
  - the website formatting is limited to markdown, but
  [markdown can still do a lot](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/)
- TODO: As a place holder, add a heading at the end for `Reviews` and make up two quotes to
  put in this section.
  - Use Markdown syntax for the quotes.
  - after the review phase, you can replace this with two real quotes from your fellow
  food critics.
- TODO: finish up by removing _all_ unneeded material below line 6.

# Allegheny College, CMPSC 105.00 Data Exploration

## <span style="color:green">Course Description</span>

>An introduction to the methods of collecting, exploring, transforming and visualizing data for
>storytelling. Often participating in team-based and hands-on activities, students learn how to
>use web platforms and dashboards to acquire, explore and investigate data to generate summarized
>key data insights using visual techniques. Students also apply open-source programming language to
>discover patterns in the data, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using graphical representations.
>During a weekly laboratory session, students employ cutting-edge software tools to complete projects,>reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited
>to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are
>available for use during class and lab sessions.

_Prerequisite:_ None

_Distribution Requirements:_ QR, SP.

DR tag rationale: This course will primarily focus on methods of data collection, foundational data analysis of numerical data, and visualizations of such data. Additionally, students will participate in the scientific process during the exploratory data analysis and apply scientific reasoning to analyze and synthesize data.

## <span style="color:green">Learning Outcomes</span>

- Develop hypotheses based on motivating problems and/or observations and identify appropriate data to address hypotheses.
- Identify and describe key elements in different types of data visualizations.
- Use web-based platforms to accurately present data sets through multiple visualizations.
- Use an open-source programming language to compute summary statistics and visualize key patterns in the data.
- Contribute to and present structured, web-based documentation that describes data exploration steps and visualization-based conclusions.

## <span style="color:green">Additional Outcomes</span>

**Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge
aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world;
apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and
create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an
understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

**Quantitative Reasoning (QR)**: Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand,
investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information
towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate
an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic
representations.
