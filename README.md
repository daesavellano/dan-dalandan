## How to update this website with content

realistic, but keep in mind that this website is viewable online.

- TODO: fill out the `index.md` with a description of the concept of your restaurant
  - `index.md` will become the home page of the website automatically, so include
    information that you think belongs on the home page.
- TODO: fill out the `menu.md` with at least one menu item and one photo
  - `menu.md` will automatically be linked in the website header for easy access.

## How to review another site

After Monday the 19th, look for `assigned review` document in Discord.
There you will find the websites that you need to review. Look at the sites and pretend
that you have eaten at that restaurant. In the `_explorations/review1.md` follow the
TODOs and write your first review. In the `_explorations/review2.md` follow the TODOs
and write your second review.

- TODO: submit your changes to GitHub
  - See below for `How to push your work onto GitHub`

## What to do after the reviews are written

Visit the website of your reviewers and find one quote from each review of
your restaurant. Add these quotes to your home page! Gatorgrade will look
for quote syntax in markdown.

Also look at your analytics data. In `_explorations/analytics.md` write about the
different sources of data contributing to the analytics automatic dashboards.
If you were a real restaurant owner, explain how this information could help
you improve your business and why you came to your conclusions.
